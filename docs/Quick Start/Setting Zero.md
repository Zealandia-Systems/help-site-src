After pressing “Home”, your machine will return to the back left corner.

From here, install the first tool into the router collet and start the process to set our Work Position (stock) Origin.

Hint:
Our Work Position Origin is the point that we tell our machine where our material is, and how the material is orientated on the machine bed.
