# READ BEFORE OPERATING

DANGER: Do not enter the machining area any time the machine is in motion, or at any time that machine motion is possible. Severe injury or death may result. Motion is possible when the power is on and the machine is not in [EMERGENCY STOP].

## Basic safety:

    • This machine can cause severe bodily injury.
    • This machine is automatically controlled and may start at any time.
    • Consult your local safety codes and regulations before you operate the machine. Contact your dealer if you have questions about safety issues.
    • It is the machine owner’s responsibility to make sure that everyone who is involved in installing and operating the machine is fully acquainte with the operation and safety instructions provided with the machine, BEFORE they work with the machine. The ultimate responsibility for safety rests with the machine owner and the individuals who work with the machine.
    • Use appropriate eye and ear protection when you operate the machine.
    • Use appropriate gloves to remove processed material and to clean the machine.

## Electrical safety:

    • The electrical power must meet the required specifications. Attempting to run the machine from any other source can cause severe damage and will void the warranty.
    • The electrical panel should be closed and the key and latches on the control cabinet should be secured at all times, except during installation and service. At those times, only qualified electricians should have access to the panel. When the main circuit breaker is on, there is high voltage throughout the electrical panel (including the circuit boards and logic circuits) and some components operate at high temperatures; therefore, extreme caution is required. Once the machine is installed, the control cabinet must be locked, with the key available only to qualified service personnel.
    • Do not reset a circuit breaker until the reason for the fault is investigated and understood. Only Zealandia Systems-trained service personnel should troubleshoot and repair Zealandia Systems equipment.
    • Do not [Turn On] on the control cabinet before the machine is fully installed.

## Operation Safety:

DANGER: To avoid injury verify that the spindle has stopped turning before opening the doors. In the event of a loss of power the spindle will take much longer to coast to a stop.

    • Do not operate the machine unless the doors are closed and the door interlocks are functioning correctly.
    • Check for damaged parts and tools before you operate the machine. Any part or tool that is damaged should be properly repaired or replaced by authorized personnel. Do not operate the machine if any component does not appear to be functioning correctly.
    • Rotating cutting tools can cause severe injury. When a program runs, spindle head can move rapidly at any time.
    • Improperly clamped parts machined at high speeds/feeds may be ejected from the machine. It is not safe to machine oversized or marginally clamped parts.

### Release of person trapped in the machine:

    • No person should ever be located inside the machineduring operation.
    • In the unlikely event that a person is trapped inside the machine the emergency stop button should be immediately be depressed and the person removed.
    • If the person is pinched or entangled the machine should be powered off; then the machine axes can be moved by use of a large external force in the direction required to free the person.
    • If the person is pinched or entangled under the Z Axis, the machine will need to be repowered and the Emergency Stop released and the Z axis to be homed.  This can be done a multiple of ways 
        • By Homing the overall Machine with the Blue "Homing" Button in Gladius
        • By Homing only the Z Axis through Gladius Coordinates Interface
        • By Homing through console by typing "G28.8 A Z"

### Recover from a jam or blockage:

    • Use lifting equipment or get assistance for lifting heavy and awkward parts.
    • Of a tool and material/part - Close the doors, press [RESET] to clear and displayed alarms. Jog the axis so the tool and material are clear.
    • Of the Automatic Tool Changer/tool and spindle:

    • If the alarms do not reset or you are unable to clear a blockage, contact your Reseller for assistance.

### Follow these guidelines when you work with the machine:

    • Normal operation - Keep the door closed and guards in place (for non-enclosed machines) while the machine operates.
    • Part loading and unloading – An operator opens the door, completes the task, closes the door, and then presses [CYCLE START] (starting automatic motion).
    • Machining job set-up – When set-up is complete, turn the set-up key to lock out set-mode and remove the key.
    • Maintenance / Machine Cleaner– Press [EMERGENCY STOP] or [POWER OFF] on the machine before you enter the enclosure.

### Periodic inspection of machine safety features:

    • Inspect door interlock mechanism for proper fit and function.
    • Inspect safety windows and enclosure for damage or leaks.
    • Verify all enclosure panels are in place.

### Door Safety Interlock inspection:

    • Inspect the door interlock, verify the door interlock key is not bent, misaligned, and that all fasteners are installed.
    • Inspect the door interlock itself for any signs of obstruction or misalignment.
    • Immediately replace an components of the Door Safety Interlock system that do not meet this criteria.

### Door Safety Interlock verification:

    • With the machine in run mode, close the machine door, run the spindle at 100 RPM, pull the door and verify the door does not open.


### MACHINE ENCLOSURE AND SAFETY GLASS

INSPECTION AND TESTING:

Routine Inspection:

    • Visually inspect the enclosure and safety glass for any signs of distortion, breakage or other damage. Replace the Lexan windows after 7 years or if they are damaged or severely scratched.
    • Keep all safety glass and machine windows clean to allow proper viewing of the machine during operations.
    • A daily visual inspection of the machine enclosure to verify all panels are in place should be performed.

Testing of machine enclosure:

    • No testing of the machine enclosure is necessary.
