# Unattended Operation

Fully enclosed Zealandia Systems CNC machines are designed to operate unattended; however, your machining process may not be safe to operate unmonitored.

As it is the shop owner’s responsibility to set up the machine safely and use best practice machining techniques, it is also the owner’s  esponsibility to manage the progress of these methods. You must monitor your machining process to prevent damage, injury, or loss of life if a hazardous condition occurs. 

For example, if there is the risk of fire due to the material machined, then you must install an appropriate fire suppression system to reduce the risk of harm to personnel, equipment, and the building. Contact a specialist to install monitoring tools before machines are allowed to run unattended.

It is especially important to select monitoring equipment that can immediately detect a problem and perform an appropriate action without human intervention.
