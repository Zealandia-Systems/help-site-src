# Machine Run



## Moving the machine

On the right hand side of Gladius there is a box called "Axes". There are button called "Y+", "X+", "Z+" etc. These buttons are used to move the machine around. To change the distance it moves click on the button next to "Z0" (default will be "0.001mm"). It will bring a drop down menu with a list of diffent move steps.
