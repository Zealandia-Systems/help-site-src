# Depth Issue

If you are having random depth issue make sure to clean the machine/ travel oil off the collect. Because of this the tool can move during a cut which can cause random depth cut issues.   You will find that an upcut will pull a tool into the work piece, whereas a downcut will push the tool out of the workpiece.
